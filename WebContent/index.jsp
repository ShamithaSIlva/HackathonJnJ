  <h3>Nutrition: School-Age</h3>
  
  
  <p>School-age children (ages 8 to 11) need healthy foods and nutritious snacks. 
  They have a consistent but slow rate of growth and usually eat four to five times a day (including snacks). 
  Many food habits, likes, and dislikes are established during this time. 
  Family, friends, and the media (especially TV) influence their food choices and eating habits. 
  School-age children are often willing to eat a wider variety of foods than their younger siblings. 
  Eating healthy after-school snacks is important, too, as these snacks may contribute up to one-third of the total calorie intake for the day. 
  School-age children have developed more advanced feeding skills and are able to help with meal preparation.</p> 
  <p>
  <h3>The following are some helpful mealtime hints for school-age children:</h3>
Always serve breakfast, even if it has to be "on the run." Some ideas for a quick, healthy breakfast include:
<ul>
<li>Fruit</li>

<li>Milk</li>

<li>Bagel</li>

<li>Cheese toast</li>

<li>Cereal</li>

<li>Peanut butter sandwich </li>
</ul>

<h3>Take advantage of big appetites after school by serving healthy snacks, such as:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fruit</li>

<li>Vegetables and dip</li>

<li>Yogurt</li>

<li>Turkey or chicken sandwich</li>

<li>Cheese and crackers</li>

<li>Milk and cereal</li></ul>

<h3>Set good examples for eating habits.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Allow children to help with meal planning and preparation.</li>

<li>Serve meals at the table, instead of in front of the television, to avoid distractions.</li>

<li>Healthy food choices</li>

<li>The Choose My Plate icon is a guideline to help you and your child eat a healthy diet.</li>

<h3> Albert Einstein Facts </h3>
<p> 
Albert Einstein is perhaps the most famous scientist of all time. Both his image and brilliant work on theoretical physics live on today and he serves as an inspiration to young scientists around the world.

Read on for interesting facts, quotes and information about Albert Einstein.

 	

<ul>
<li>Albert Einstein was born on the 14th of March 1879 and died on the 18th of April 1955.</li>

<li>Born in Germany to a Jewish family, Einstein made many contributions to the field of theoretical physics.</li>

<li>Even when very young, Einstein showed great ability in both mathematics and science. He was naturally curious and had a brilliant analytical mind.</li>

<li>Einstein worked in a patent office evaluating patents for electromagnetic devices not long after he graduated.</li>

<li>He produced perhaps one of the most famous equations ever: E = mc² (energy equals mass multiplied by the speed of light squared).</li>

<li>He is also well known for his theory of relativity. Special relativity being introduced in his 1905 paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies
 before Einstein developed the theory of general relativity between the years of 1907 and 1915.</li>

<li>Einstein won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on theoretical physics.</li>

<li>He worked on many other influential theories and projects including: the deflection of light by gravity, 
the quantum theory of atomic motion in solids, Brownian motion, an explanation for capillary action and much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Famous Albert Einstein quotes include: "Whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory which you use.
 It is the theory which decides what can be observed."

"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music.... 
I do know that I get most joy in life out of my violin."

"Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world."

"I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. 
Imagination encircles the world."

  <h3> Why Is Math So Important for Kids to Learn? </h3>
<p> Many kids ask their math teacher why learning a particular mathematical concept or skill is important. When helping kids out with their homework, many parents may wonder the same thing. Mark H. Karwan, the Dean of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the University of Buffalo, points out that parental attitudes -- positive or negative -- can influence childrens attitudes about math, and ultimately their performance. Encourage your child to excel in this area, as he’ll have increased functioning and opportunities in his life and career as a result.</p>
<h3> Maths Glorious History</h3>
<p> In the 1920s, the teaching of algebra and geometry in the United States was regarded as an intellectual luxury.In fact, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Education referred to algebra as a useless subject, according to author David Klein in his paper A Brief History of of American K-12 Mathematics Education in the 20th Century. During this time, students were taught basic math skills that had immediate practical applications. After World War II, policymakers began to advocate for a stronger math curriculum, a movement that increased with the space race of the 1950s. In the 21st century, schools are working to increase students’ higher math skills so that the citizens of the United States can be competitive in a global economy. </p>
<h3> Teaches Logical and Critical Thinking </h3>
<p> Math teaches logic and order. You can expect a mathematical equation to have a predictable outcome, and precise steps must be followed in order to attain that result. The discipline of mind that children develop in math class can carry over into everyday life. Companies know this, as some businesses will hire math majors based on the presumption that students who are good at math have learned how to think. Math can also provide a vehicle through which critical-thinking skills are put into practice and refined. An example of mathematical critical thinking is when students are required to explain how they arrived at a solution to a complex problem or to describe the ideas behind a formula or procedure.</p>

<h3> Teaches Life Skills </h3>
<p> It is next to impossible to live an independent life without basic math skills. Children begin to learn about money in the early elementary grades, and in later grades can calculate percentages and fractions. People must have these skills in order to follow a recipe, evaluate whether or not an item on clearance is a good deal and manage a budget, among other things. Financial analyst Mike Walker points out that kids must be proficient at math in order to buy a car without getting taken for the wrong kind of ride. </p>
<h3> Supports Continuing Education and Careers </h3>
<p> Even entry-level jobs in fields seemingly unrelated to mathematics require math skills. Cashiers must be able to count money accurately, while a customer service representative may need to be able to discuss a discrepancy in a customer’s bill. Students who are skilled at math and who seek a higher degree will find that high-paying careers such as engineering, medicine and research become available to them. Students who are not interested in these careers must nonetheless have advanced math skills, as they are required to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in any field. Students who have better math skills than their peers may obtain scholarships based on their superior performance on assessment tests such as the SAT and ACT. </p>

<h3> Your Daily Math</h3>

<p> Students may ask why math is necessary, but quality math instruction must ensure that this question is asked infrequently. Instruction should incorporate techniques that are designed to demonstrate to children the relevancy of math to their daily lives, the world around them and their future careers. Math teachers must strive to provide a real-world context for the skills that they teach and must tell students the rationale behind the concept they are teaching.</p>

<h3> Introducing children to engineering in elementary school brings a host of benefits </h3>
<p> If you’ve ever watched children at play, you know they’re fascinated with building things—and with taking things apart to see how they work. In other words, children are natural-born engineers. When children engineer in a school setting, research suggests several positive results: </p>
<h3> Building Science and Math Skills </h3>
<p> Engineering calls for children to apply what they know about science and math—and their learning is enhanced as a result. At the same time, because engineering activities are based on real-world technologies and problems, they help children see how disciplines like math and science are relevant to their lives. </p>
<h3> Classroom Equity </h3>
<p> Research suggests that engineering activities help build classroom equity. The engineering design process removes the stigma from failure; instead, failure is an important part of the problem-solving process and a positive way to learn. It is equally important that there’s no single “right” answer in engineering; one problem can have many solutions. When classroom instruction includes engineering, all students can see themselves as successful. </p>
<h3> 21st Century Skills</h3>
<p> Hands-on, project-based learning is the essence of engineering. As groups of students work together to answer questions like, “How large should I make the canopy of this parachute?” or, “What material should I use for the blades of my windmill?” they collaborate, think critically and creatively, and communicate with one another.</p>
<h3> Career Success </h3>
<p> Classroom engineering activities often require students to work in teams where they must collaborate and communicate effectively. In the 21st century, these skills will be critical for career success in any field.

Research also shows that when engineering is part of elementary instruction, students become more aware of the diverse opportunities for engineering, science, and technical careers—and they are more likely to see these careers as options they could choose.

This finding is important at a time when the number of U.S. college students pursuing engineering education is decreasing. Early introduction to engineering can encourage many capable students—but especially girls and minorities—to consider engineering as a career and take the necessary science and math courses in high school.</p>
