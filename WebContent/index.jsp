  <h3>Nutrition: School-Age</h3>
  
  <p>School-age children (ages 8 to 11) need healthy foods and nutritious snacks. 
  They have a consistent but slow rate of growth and usually eat four to five times a day (including snacks). 
  Many food habits, likes, and dislikes are established during this time. 
  Family, friends, and the media (especially TV) influence their food choices and eating habits. 
  School-age children are often willing to eat a wider variety of foods than their younger siblings. 
  Eating healthy after-school snacks is important, too, as these snacks may contribute up to one-third of the total calorie intake for the day. 
  School-age children have developed more advanced feeding skills and are able to help with meal preparation.</p> 
  <p>
  <h3>The following are some helpful mealtime hints for school-age children:</h3>
Always serve breakfast, even if it has to be "on the run." Some ideas for a quick, healthy breakfast include:
<ul>
<li>Fruit</li>

<li>Milk</li>

<li>Bagel</li>

<li>Cheese toast</li>

<li>Cereal</li>

<li>Peanut butter sandwich </li>
</ul>

<h3>Take advantage of big appetites after school by serving healthy snacks, such as:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fruit</li>

<li>Vegetables and dip</li>

<li>Yogurt</li>

<li>Turkey or chicken sandwich</li>

<li>Cheese and crackers</li>

<li>Milk and cereal</li></ul>

<h3>Set good examples for eating habits.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Allow children to help with meal planning and preparation.</li>

<li>Serve meals at the table, instead of in front of the television, to avoid distractions.</li>

<li>Healthy food choices</li>

<li>The Choose My Plate icon is a guideline to help you and your child eat a healthy diet.</li>

<h3> Albert Einstein Facts </h3>
<p> 
Albert Einstein is perhaps the most famous scientist of all time. Both his image and brilliant work on theoretical physics live on today and he serves as an inspiration to young scientists around the world.

Read on for interesting facts, quotes and information about Albert Einstein.

 	

<ul>
<li>Albert Einstein was born on the 14th of March 1879 and died on the 18th of April 1955.</li>

<li>Born in Germany to a Jewish family, Einstein made many contributions to the field of theoretical physics.</li>

<li>Even when very young, Einstein showed great ability in both mathematics and science. He was naturally curious and had a brilliant analytical mind.</li>

<li>Einstein worked in a patent office evaluating patents for electromagnetic devices not long after he graduated.</li>

<li>He produced perhaps one of the most famous equations ever: E = mc² (energy equals mass multiplied by the speed of light squared).</li>

<li>He is also well known for his theory of relativity. Special relativity being introduced in his 1905 paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies
 before Einstein developed the theory of general relativity between the years of 1907 and 1915.</li>

<li>Einstein won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on theoretical physics.</li>

<li>He worked on many other influential theories and projects including: the deflection of light by gravity, 
the quantum theory of atomic motion in solids, Brownian motion, an explanation for capillary action and much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Famous Albert Einstein quotes include: "Whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory which you use.
 It is the theory which decides what can be observed."

"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music.... 
I do know that I get most joy in life out of my violin."

"Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world."

"I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. 
Imagination encircles the world."

                  <p>Early electronic computers, developed around the 1940s,  were the size of a large room and consumed huge amounts of electricity. They  were vastly different to the modern computers we use today, especially when  compared to small and portable laptop computers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Computers are programmed to carry out instructions. These  instructions are usually very simple and require adding numbers together,  moving data from one place to another etc.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>A computer program can include as little as a few  instructions to upwards of millions of instructions depending on the complexity  of the program. Modern applications such as word processors, web browsers and  graphic editors take large teams of programmers a long time to complete.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>A computer&rsquo;s memory stores numbers in huge amounts of cells  that are addressed and can be quickly accessed by the CPU to perform  calculations. There are two main types of computer memory, ROM (read only  memory) and RAM (random access memory). ROM contains pre-written software and  data that the CPU can only read, while RAM can be accessed and written to at  any time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Computers interact with a number of different I/O (input/output)  devices to exchange information. These peripheral devices include the keyboard,  mouse, display, hard drive, printer and more.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Computers are used to help link the world in the form of  networks. Networked computers allow users to share and exchange data that is  stored in different locations. You may have heard of a local area network (LAN)  or wide area network (WAN) which connects areas of various sizes. The Internet  is a vast network of computers spanning the globe that allows users to access  email, the World Wide Web and other applications.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Although we normally think of computers as the ones we use in our  everyday lives to surf the web, write documents etc, small computers are also  embedded into other things such as mobile phones, toys, microwaves and MP3  players. We use computers all the time, often without even knowing it!</p>
